# Reporting Security Issues

We at telli and the FWU value the security community and believe that responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in telli, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem. Before reporting though, please review our responsible disclosure policy, and those things that should not be reported.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, whean reporting a security vulnerability, you have the following options to reach out to us:

- **Option 1: GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting System**: We encourage you to use GitHub's Vulnerability Reporting system to report any security vulnerabilities you find. This allows us to receive vulnerability reports directly through GitHub. For more information on how to submit a security advisory report, please refer to the [GitHub Security documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

- **Option 2: Email**: Submit your report to [security@telli.schule](mailto:security@telli.schule) (one issue per report) and respond to the report with any updates.

Please do not contact employees directly or through other channels about a report.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

We ask that:

- You give us reasonable time to investigate and mitigate an issue you report before making public any information about the report or sharing such information with others.
- You do not interact with an individual account (which includes modifying or accessing data from the account) if the account owner has not consented to such actions.
- You make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others, including (but not limited to) destruction of data and interruption or degradation of our services.
- You do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason. (This includes demonstrating additional risk, such as attempted compromise of sensitive company data or probing for additional issues).
- You do not violate any other applicable laws or regulations.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English or German.
